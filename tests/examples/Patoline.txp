== Introduction ==

== Usage ==

=== Producing pdf ===

To write a patoline document, you must create a file with the
extension \verb{.txp}.  This file can be created using any text
editor. At the moment an emacs mode is provided by the distribution
and probably other modes will come soon.

Next you need to "compile" your file by entering in a terminal the following command:

\verb{patoline myfile.txp} \cr
This should either produce a pdf file \verb{myfile.pdf} or an error message.

From emacs, you can just type \verb{Ctrl-C Ctrl-C} to achieve the same result. 

If your document uses multiple files, the sub-files must be compiled
using the \verb{-c} compilation option of patoline. Soon, this will
not be needed as patoline will computes the dependency of your
document.
 
=== inverse search ===

inverse search is the possibility to click in the produced pdf document and 
see the corresponding lines of the source document. 

Patoline implements this with external links in the document (URI).
To use this feature you must add the compilation option \verb{--edit-link}
to the \verb{patoline} command.

Unfortunately, the standard \verb{file:filename} URI does not provide
a way to specify position in a text file. Therefore, Patoline uses its own non standard URI:

    \verb{edit:filename@linuenum@colnum}

Most pdf reader will not understand this external link. Here are what you can do for some readers.
First in the \verb{Tools} folder of patoline distribution, there is a python script that 
call \verb{emacsclient} to open the file. Similar script are easy to write for other text editors.  

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb{xpdf}: add the line \verb{urlCommand "pdfclick '%s'"} to your \verb{.xpdfrc}
\item \verb{mupdf}: define the environment variable \verb{BROWSER} to point to pdfclick.
\end{itemize}

=== Forward search ===

This is the reciprocal feature : to show in your pdf viewer the current position in the file you are editing.
This is currently not implemented in Patoline, but we plan to extend some pdf reader (probably \verb{mupdf})
to support this feature. 

Another possibility will be by using a planned future OpenGL engine for Patoline instead of a pdf reader.
 
== Structure of the document ==

=== Titre ===

To give the title of your document, it should start with something like:

###
==============
   Titre
--------------
   Author
--------------
   Institute
==============
###

The fields author and institute are optional. 
This will be improved with more tags possible
and a flexible way to define the layout
of the title. The must be at least 10 equal signs. 

=== Sections ===

You document may use sections, sub-sections, …
There are $2 × 2 = 4$ type of section  in patoline:

\begin{itemize}
\item Numbered absolute section:
###
== Section niveau 1 ==
=== Section niveau 2 ===
...
###

\item Unnumbered absolute section:
###
-- Section niveau 1 --
--- Section niveau 2 ---
...
###

\item Numbered relative section
###
=> Section title

Section text
=<
###

\item Unnumbered relative section
###
-> Section title
 
Section text
-<
###
\end{itemize}

Relative or absolute sections have their own advantages: relative section
can be easily moved at various levels, but they cause syntax error when they are not 
properly closed.

Then, it is easy to add a table of contents:

###
\Caml(let _ = table_of_contents ())
###

Or if you want to control what depth is printed (this should be
accessible without entering OCaml section in future versions):

###
\Caml(let _ = table_of_contents ~max_depth:4 ())
###

== Text layout ==

Here are standard possibilities for texts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb{\bold{text}} : write text in \bold{bold}.
\item \verb{\italic{text}} : write text in \italic{italic}.
\item \verb{\bold{\italic{text}}} : to \bold{\italic{combine both}}.
\item \verb{\sc{text}} : to write text using \sc{Small Capitals}.
\item \verb{\verb{text}} : to write \verb{verbatim text} i.e. text which is printed as it is written, except line breaking and spaces. If your verbatim text uses curly braces, you have nothing special to do as long as you curly braces match. Otherwise, you can use \verb{\\\{} or \verb{\\\}} for non matched curly brace and \verb{\\\\} if you want to write a backslash that will be followed by a curly brace or a backslash. However, a backslash followed by other charaters do not need to be escaped. This means that most of the time you do not need to escape anything inside \verb{\verb}. By the way, the above examples, where printed using \verb{\verb{\\\\\\\{}}, \verb{\verb{\\\\\\\}}} and \verb{\verb{\\\\\\\\}}.


There is another command if you want fixed spaces and line breaking:
###
       ###
         many lines
           in verbatim mode
       ###
### 
will produce the line exactly as you entered them (this is used to print what you see !).
Here there are no escaping mechanism so it is impossible to start a line with \verb{###} (*"*)
in verbatim mode. However, 3 closing double quotes have to be at the beginning of the line, other wise their will be printed verbatim. This is what we used above.
 
\end{itemize}
== Mathematics ==

Mathematics are signaled by \verb{$ a formula in text mode$} or
\verb{$$ a formula in display mode$$} … FIXME BY REALLY DOING THAT.
