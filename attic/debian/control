Description: Digital typography system written in OCaml
 Patoline is a digital typography system, similar to TeX or Microsoft Word, but
 using an up-to-date language and algorithm, and leveraging the power of
 present-day computers. In particular:
 .
  * The amount of memory we have today is in no way comparable to what Knuth
    had when he first wrote TeX in the 1970s.
  * Also, the choice of our favourite programming language is no more limited
    by "what compiles on all machines of the laboratory".
  * The global network has changed: today, nobody knows anyone on the net.

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, fonts-oflb-asana-math-full, fonts-philosopher, fonts-alegreya, fonts-euler
Description: An empty package to pull standard fonts for Patoline
 The only purpose of this package is to depend on other font packages which
 provide Opentype fonts used by Patoline core document formats.

Package: fonts-oflb-asana-math-full
Architecture: all

Section: fonts
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Conflicts: fonts-oflb-asana-math
Provides: fonts-oflb-asana-math
Replaces: fonts-oflb-asana-math
Description: Extended smart Unicode Math font
 Asana Math provides rich Unicode coverage of the Maths-related blocks and
 support for the MATH Opentype table which means that it can be used to typeset
 documents with complex mathematical requirements using tools like XeTeX.
 .
 Fonts contained in this package provide more symbols that the original
 Debian package fonts-oflb-asana-math.

Package: fonts-euler

 This package provides the Opentype Philosopher fonts designed by Jovanny
 Lemonad. It has been downloaded from: <http://www.jovanny.ru/>.

Description: Alegreya font family
 This package provides the Opentype Alegreya fonts designed by Juan Pablo Del
 Peral. According to <http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Alegreya>:
 .
 Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 “Fonts of the Decade” at the ATypI Letter2
 competition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type systems. It was
 also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño, competition held in
 Madrid in 2010.
 .
 Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning
 characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the
 reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring
 to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a
 contemporary typographic language.
 .
 The italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the
 roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are really
 experimental for the genre. This is the Small Caps sister family that
 complements the master Alegreya family.
 .
 Not only does Alegreya provide great performance, but also achieves a strong
 and harmonious text by means of elements designed in an atmosphere of
 diversity.

Package: vim-syntax-patoline
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, vim
Recommends: vim-addons-manager, patoline
Description: Patoline typography system - Vim highlighting syntax files
 This package provides syntax files for editing Patoline .txp files in Vim
 with syntax highlighting.

Package: patoline-mode
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, xemacs21-nomule | emacsen
Recommends: patoline, patoline-driver-gl
Enhances: patoline
Description: Emacs mode for Patoline
 Syntax highlighting for Patoline documents in Emacs, along with integration
 with Patoline compilation process.
 .
 This mode also provides interaction the rendered output, which can be used
 to point back to the source code corresponding to an excerpt of the output.

Package: patoline-driver-gl
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${F:OCamlRun}, patoline, liblablgl-ocaml-dev
Description: OpenGL output driver for Patoline
 The SVG driver produces an executable binary file from a source document. When
 this executable code is run, it displays on-screen the typeset document using
 the GL API for rasterizing fonts. It embeds its own antialiasing and subpixel
 rendering algorithms, which aim at providing a high quality output.

Package: patoline-driver-svg
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${F:OCamlRun}, libtypography-ocaml-dev
Description: SVG output driver for Patoline
 This driver typesets a Patoline document to a SVG image, which should be
 correctly displayed by modern browsers as well as SVG viewers and editors.

Package: patoline-driver-cairo
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${F:OCamlRun}, libtypography-ocaml-dev
Description: Cairo output driver for Patoline

Package: patoline-driver-html
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${F:OCamlRun}, libtypography-ocaml-dev
Description: HTML output driver for Patoline
 This driver outputs HTML5 files for a document, which should be correctly
 parsed and displayed by recent browsers. No layout aspect (line breaking,
 word and letter spacing) is left to the browser: the output is no idiomatic
 HTML5, since the file tells the browser where each character should be
 typeset.

Package: patoline-format-lm
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${F:OCamlRun}, fonts-lmodern
Description: Patoline format using Latin Modern fonts
 This format attempts to provide the same internal interface as Patoline core
 article format, while replacing output fonts with Latin Modern fonts.
 .
 One may use this format in a desperate attempt to trick someone into
 thinking that a document could have been produced by (La)TeX, yet using the
 full power of Patoline.

Description: Delimited Continuation Parser (DeCaP)
  DeCaP is a new parser combinator library written in OCaml. Although DeCaP
  can be used to write parsers directly, it is intended to be used in conjunction
  with pa_ocaml, which is a full-featured parser for the OCaml language, written
  using DeCaP. These two tools together provide an easy and integrated way to
  write parsers and syntax extensions for the OCaml language.
