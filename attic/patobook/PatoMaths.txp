=> Mathematical formulas

Patoline's mathematical system is based on a syntax quite close to what
you would use to speak orally of mathematics, on the phone, for instance.
But, since Patoline is a computing program, and not a fellow
mathematician, it is much more picky about what it considers ``valid''
maths. However, unlike your colleagues, it won't complain if you try to
customize its understanding of mathematics.

Patoline's pickiness comes from the fact that it first needs to
understand your formulas unambiguously, in order to compute the
correct spacing between its symbols. Then, it uses tricky numerical
algorithms to do its best and optimize the spacing of formulas. Even
though the current version of Patoline does not compensate optical
illusions, or precisely computes ink density, this is clearly one of
our long-term goals.

The grammar of mathematical formulas is based on a technology called
\emph{dypgen}, that allows for ambiguous grammars. If your grammar is
ambiguous, that is, the same valid expression may have different
meanings, then Patoline will not be able to find the right spacings,
and will tell you to correct it. Most of the time, adding curly brackets
at the right places is enough to satisfy it.

=> Typing maths in patoline

Most mathematical formulas, in patoline, are typed between \verb{$}
signs.  For instance, writing \verb{$x$} yields the following result:
$x$.  Writing operations is not much more complicated: $a+b$ is simply
written \verb{$a+b$}. Again, like \verb{\\\\} yielded a \\ sign in the
output, \verb{\\$} can be used to get a plain \$ sign.

There are thirteen classes of special symbols in Patoline:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Additive operators, like ${+}$ or ${∪}$
\item Multiplicative operators, like ${⋅}$, ${×}$ or ${∩}$
\item Big operators, like ${∑}$ or ${∫}$
\item Prefix operators, like ${+}$, ${-}$ or ${⊢}$
\item Postfix operators, like ${!}$ (*, ${*}$*) (* FIXME *)
(*\item Accents, like ${'}$*) (* FIXME *)
\item Arrows, like ${→}$, ${⇒}$, ${↪}$ or ${↠}$
\item Logical connectors, like ${\land}$, ${\lor}$, ${¬}$
\item Relations, like ${=}$, ${∈}$, or ${≡}$
\item Quantifiers, like ${∀}$ or ${∃}$
\item Negations, like ${¬}$
\item Punctuation, like ${…}$, ${.}$ or ${,}$
\item Delimiters, like ${\{\nothing\}}$, ${(\nothing)}$ or ${||\nothing||}$
\end{enumerate}

These symbols all have a way to call them in ascii; that is, they can
all be called by a normal Patoline command like \verb{\\int} or
\verb{\\forall}, with no special or accentuated characters.  However,
many symbols have a unicode representation, and Patoline also accepts
UTF-8 encodings of these. Several symbols have already been defined in Patoline.
Chapter \sectref("defined symbols") of this book is automatically generated
to include all symbols from Patoline's default grammar.

First of all, any symbol can be made a normal symbol by surrounding it
with curly braces: to get a ${∀}$ in the middle of a sentence, we just
have to write ##${∀}$##, or ##{\\forall}##.

To get a formula in \emph{display style}, you may just use two dollar signs
instead of one: for instance, \verb{$$a+b$$} will produce the following result:

$$a+b$$
