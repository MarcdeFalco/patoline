#
# QUIET OUTPUT
# ============
# We define $(Q) and $(ECHO) variables to handle pretty printing and
# quiet output.
#
# The makefiles of this project define standard pattern rules to call
# various OCaml tools.  They suppress make's usual output, and echo
# instead a short summary of the command being run.
#
# $(Q), standing for "Quiet", is used to control this behavior. Its
# default value is "@" to suppress make default output. If you want to
# get back the full compilation trace, append "Q=" to make invocation,
# as in:
#
#    make Q=
#
# i.e., setting $(Q) to the empty string.
#
# Every command in Patoline makefiles should be prefixed by $(Q).
#
# The $(ECHO) variable is a regular call to "echo" when quiet output is
# activated. When normal output is chosen instead, $(ECHO) does nothing.
Q=@
ifeq "$(strip $(Q))" "@"
  ECHO=@echo
